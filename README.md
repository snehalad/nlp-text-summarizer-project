The Purpose of this notebook is to build an NLP model to make reading medical abstracts easier.

The paper we're replicating (the source of the dataset thet we'll be using) is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071

And reading through the paper above, we see that the model architecture that they use to achieve their best results is available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05251
